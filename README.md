# Priority Scheme Optimization Tool

This tool models earth-imaging satellite capabilities and uses gradient descent to optimize how the satellite will choose imaging targets. 
The prioritization scheme is considered optimized when the revenue generated by the model is maximized. The model is supplied with a list of orders all having specific location data and dollar amounts associated to them.

## Requirements and Libraries
- Python 3
- math
- Matplotlib.pyplot
- pandas
- random
- scipy.optimize

## Input Files
There are two files that must be formatted and supplied as .csv files to the pri_scheme.py file: a list of orders and a list of images. The list of orders must contain the following columns:
- Index
- Cust_Num
- Task_Pri
- DollarPerSquare
- Latitude

The list of images must have the following colums:
- Index
- START_TIME
- CC
- AVG_ONA
- Latitude
- EVEN_OR_OD
- VEHICLE

## How To Run
Run the tool in the terminal with the following command:
python pri_scheme.py .\run_input_parameters.json .\Curve_Test_Cases.csv

Where the Curve_Test_Cases.csv is the file containing the starting coefficients for each test case. The tool will find the optimal prioritization scheme and display a plot of the priorities (y-axis) vs the dollar value (x-axis). The final priority values will be printed in the consel.
